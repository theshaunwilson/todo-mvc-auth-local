# Todo Application Overview

## What This App Does

This is a todo list application where users can:

1. Create personal accounts
2. Add, complete, and delete todos
3. Track their progress
4. Keep their todos private and secure

## How It's Built (MVC Pattern)

- **Model**: Handles data and database rules
- **View**: Shows pages to users
- **Controller**: Contains the application logic

## Basic User Flow

1. User creates account or logs in
2. Views their personal todo list
3. Can create, complete, or delete todos
4. Everything saves to their account

- `models/User.js`

  - Defines user data structure (username, email, password)
  - Handles password hashing using bcrypt
  - Has methods to compare passwords for login

- `models/Todo.js`
  - Defines todo item structure (text, completed status, user ID)
  - Links todos to specific users

## Views (What Users See)

- `views/index.ejs`

  - Home page with login/signup links
  - First page users see

- `views/login.ejs`

  - Login form
  - Shows error messages
  - Handles email/password input

- `views/signup.ejs`

  - Signup form
  - Validates user input
  - Creates new accounts

- `views/todos.ejs`
  - Main todo list interface
  - Shows todos and completion status
  - Has form for new todos
  - Links to frontend JavaScript

## Controllers (Business Logic)

- `controllers/auth.js`

  - Handles login/signup logic
  - Validates user input
  - Manages user sessions

- `controllers/home.js`

  - Simple controller for home page
  - Renders index view

- `controllers/todos.js`
  - Creates new todos
  - Marks todos complete/incomplete
  - Deletes todos
  - Gets todos for display

## Supporting Files

### Routes (URL Handling)

- `routes/main.js`

  - Handles login/signup/home URLs
  - Connects URLs to auth controllers

- `routes/todos.js`
  - Handles todo-related URLs
  - Connects URLs to todo controllers

### Configuration

- `config/database.js`

  - Sets up MongoDB connection
  - Handles database errors

- `config/passport.js`
  - Sets up authentication
  - Manages how users log in
  - Handles sessions

### Middleware

- `middleware/auth.js`
  - Protects routes
  - Checks if users are logged in

### Public Files

- `public/css/style.css`

  - Basic styling
  - Todo completion status styles

- `public/js/main.js`
  - Frontend interactivity
  - Handles todo actions
  - Makes API calls to backend

### Core Setup

- `server.js`

  - Main application file
  - Sets up Express
  - Connects all parts together

- `package.json`

  - Lists all dependencies
  - Defines start scripts

- `.env`
  - Environment variables
  - Database connection string
  - Port settings

## Flow of Data

1. User visits URL â†’ Routes direct traffic
2. Middleware checks authentication
3. Controllers process the request
4. Models handle data operations
5. Views show the result
6. Public files add styling and interactivity

## Security Features

- Password hashing
- Session management
- Protected routes
- Input validation
